config SCHED_PIT
	bool "Use PIT for scheduling"

	help
	  Normally, Fiasco uses the RTC at IRQ8 for scheduling. This can be
	  disadvantageous in certain circumstances, e.g. VMWare doesn't seem
	  to emulate the RTC good enough so that not enough timer interrupts
	  are produced. The PIT mode (using IRQ0) seems to work better in
	  this case.  It is generally safe to use this option, so if you are
	  unsure, say 'Y'.

	  Consider that the interrupt priorities change: Using RTC, IRQ8 has
	  the highest priority. Using PIT, IRQ0 has the highest priority.
	  The only case where PIT scheduling does not work is with
	  profiling. If profiling is enabled the PIT is used for generating
	  the profiling interrupts.

config SCHED_RTC
	bool "Use RTC for scheduling"
	depends on PF_PC && !MP
	help
	  'Yes' is the standard for this option. If this option is set
	  Fiasco uses the RTC on IRQ 8 for scheduling.  This can be
	  disadvantageous in certain circumstances, e.g. VMWare doesn't seem
	  to emulate the RTC good enough so that not enough timer interrupts
	  are produced.  The PIT (8254) mode (say 'no' here), seems to work
	  better in this case. It is generally safe to use the PIT, so if
	  you are unsure, say 'no'.
	  Consider that the interrupt priorities change: Using RTC, IRQ8 has
	  the highest priority. Using PIT, IRQ0 has the highest priority.
	  The only case where PIT scheduling does not work is with
	  profiling. If profiling is enabled the PIT is used for generating
	  the profiling interrupts and the RTC must be used for scheduling.
	  In the case where profiling shall be used within VMWare the
	  SLOW_RTC option must be set, so that the timer resolution of
	  Fiasco is reduced to 100Hz.
